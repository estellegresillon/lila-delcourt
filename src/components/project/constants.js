  aerials: "The best closeups I got of a thermal pool at Yellowstone National Park. The natural colors and clouds of steam blow me away. You just can't capture these views from the ground.",
  portraits: "When you photograph people in color, you photograph a scene, a moment or simply their clothes. But when you photograph people in black and white, you photograph their souls."
